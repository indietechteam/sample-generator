Plan of action:

 - Create a script to collect files based on keywords "instruments list"- "genre list" and copy into different folders in each combinations to train
 - Update the fine tune model script to run to a set number of checkpoints then output a named model based on the genre/instrument combo
 - Find a way to run this in bulk and run it!

Then:

 - I have checkpoints for key word combos
 - Create an api/web service that takes keywords and generates samples from one of the chose models...

Finally:

 - Integrate with interface that let's you search, playback and download clips?
